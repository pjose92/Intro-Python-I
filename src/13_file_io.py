"""
Python makes performing file I/O simple. Take a look
at how to read and write to files here:

"""

# Open up the "foo.txt" file (which already exists) for reading
# Print all the contents of the file, then close the file
# Note: pay close attention to your current directory when trying to open "foo.txt"

# YOUR CODE HERE
foo = open('foo.txt', "r")
print(foo.read())
foo.close()

# Open up a file called "bar.txt" (which doesn't exist yet) for
# writing. Write three lines of arbitrary content to that file,
# then close the file. Open up "bar.txt" and inspect it to make
# sure that it contains what you expect it to contain

# YOUR CODE HERE
boo = open("bar.text", "w")
boo.write("\n I'm line 1. \n I'm line 2. \n I'm line 3.")
boo.close()

boo= open("bar.text", "r")
print(boo.read())
boo.close
